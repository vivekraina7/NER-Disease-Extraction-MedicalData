## DL: Automatic Disease Identification in Medical Research Publications using _BERT_

• **Business Case**: As a data scientist at a medical research publication company, you were tasked to identify diseases mentioned in hundreds of articles published daily without manually reading each article.

• **Problem Statement**: The laborious task of manually reading articles to identify diseases can be simplified using a machine learning model. However, the challenge is to build a model with limited training data.

• **Approach**: The project utilized the BERT model from Hugging Face for training and predicting disease mentions in medical research articles. The model was fine-tuned through hyperparameter tuning to achieve better accuracy.

• **Technical Details**: The project involved importing the required libraries, loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, tokenizing the text, and encoding the target variable. The BERT model was then trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

• **Results**: The model achieved an accuracy of 93% in identifying disease mentions in medical research articles. The project demonstrated the potential of using BERT for automatic disease mention recognition in the medical domain.

• **Impact**: The project's success could lead to significant time savings in the medical research publication industry by automating the process of identifying diseases mentioned in articles, thus improving overall productivity and efficiency.
